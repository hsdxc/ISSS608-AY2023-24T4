As the chart progresses towards more exclusive properties like Terrace Houses, Semi-Detached, and Detached Houses, there’s a notable decline in unit numbers, hinting at lesser availability or possibly higher pricing brackets for such properties.\nThis trend is significant for stakeholders, indicating a potential focus area for both market demand and real estate development strategies.\nCreate new columns\n\n#Determine the address unit level.\nrealis2024Q1 &lt;- realis2024Q1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Floor Level\" = if_else(str_detect(Address, '#'),\n                                   str_trim(str_extract(str_split(Address, \"#\", simplify = TRUE)[, 2], \"^[^\\\\-]*\")),\n                                   \"N.A.\"))\n\n#Determine the address unit level category (Low, middle or high).\nrealis2024Q1 &lt;- realis2024Q1 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Floor Level Category` = case_when(\n    `Property Type` %in% c(\"Terrace House\", \"Semi-Detached House\", \"Detached House\") ~ \"N.A.\",\n    `Floor Level` == \"N.A.\" ~ \"Low\",\n    as.integer(`Floor Level`) &lt;= 5 ~ \"Low\",\n    as.integer(`Floor Level`) &lt;= 10 ~ \"Middle\",\n    TRUE ~ \"High\"\n  ))\n\nPlot Boxplot\n\n# Reorder levels of 'Property Type' alphabetically\nrealis2024Q1$`Property Type` &lt;- factor(realis2024Q1$`Property Type`, levels = c(\"Apartment\",\"Condominium\",\"Terrace House\", \"Semi-Detached House\",\"Detached House\",\"Executive Condominium\"))\n\n# Reorder levels of 'Floor Level Category' by \"High\", \"Middle\", \"Low\"\nrealis2024Q1$`Floor Level Category` &lt;- factor(realis2024Q1$`Floor Level Category`, levels = c(\"High\", \"Middle\", \"Low\"))\n\n# Create the boxplot using ggplot2\nggplot(realis2024Q1, aes(x = `Property Type`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = `Floor Level Category`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"N.A.\" = \"gray\", \"Low\" = \"blue1\", \"Middle\" =\"blue3\", \"High\" = \"blue4\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Property Type\", y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\", fill = \"Floor Level Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n** EDA 2 **\nThe boxplot analysis highlights several significant findings, with a focus on median unit prices per square metre:\n\nTerraced, semi-detached, and detached houses exhibit lower median prices in contrast to vertical living spaces such as apartments ,and condominiums. This discrepancy suggests a potential premium associated with apartment living, possibly attributed to location advantages, particularly in central urban areas.\nExecutive condominiums stand out with the lowest median price among all property types, implying a level of affordability. This could be due to the regulatory price controls.\nFurther exploration into median prices based on property type and floor levels reveals that higher floors command a premium for condominiums and apartments.\nIn contrast, executive condominiums exhibit a more uniform pricing pattern across different floors, in comparison to apartments and condominiums.\n\n** Summary**\nThe analysis of property types using Pareto charts sheds light on the distribution within the market. Condominiums and apartments emerge as prominent, aligning with the Pareto principle by occupying a significant portion of total units. This suggests either heightened demand or extensive supply in these segments.\nThis finding is further corroborated by the examination of property types using boxplots. It highlights the preference for apartment and condominium living over landed housing types, emphasizing the premium facilities associated with such accommodations.\nIn essence, these analyses provide valuable insights into the property market, emphasizing the dominance of condominiums and apartments and their impact on demand and pricing dynamics."

This layout allows each category to be individually examined without the lines overlapping, reducing visual clutter and making comparisons between categories easier.\nColor Coding and Legend: Each property type is consistently colored across all panels, and the legend clearly distinguishes these colors. This uniformity helps in quickly identifying which color corresponds to which property type across different panels.\nAverage Price Indication: Each panel includes an average price annotation, making it easy to get a quick summary of the price trend for each property type without needing to assess the data points visually. This feature adds a useful layer of information at a glance.\nVertical Axis Scaling: Each panel is scaled individually for the vertical axis, which allows for a better view of the trends within each property type. This prevents the issue where high values in one category might compress the scale of another, making finer details hard to see.\nConsistent Time Frame Across Panels: All panels cover the same time period (January to April), facilitating straightforward comparisons of trends over time between different property types.\nClarity in Data Points: The use of lighter lines and a less dense plotting of data points (compared to the jagged lines in the previous chart) improves the clarity of the visualization."

The branch it belongs to appears more consolidated, indicating possibly tighter or more scrutinized relationships. Observations Direct Network Stability:\nThe core network around SouthSeafood Express Corp remains relatively stable, with primary connections like Namorna Transit Ltd. and AguaLeska Transit N.V. still intact. Branch Consolidation:\nPost-incident, the branch including SouthSeafood Express Corp appears to have consolidated. This could indicate closer scrutiny or stronger ties among these entities to mitigate risks or manage fallout from the incident. Minor Shifts in Indirect Connections:\nSome indirect connections appear to have shifted or been restructured. For example, there are fewer connections extending from nodes like V. Miesel Shipping and Tainamarine Fishing Co, suggesting possible distancing or reduced interaction. Competing Businesses’ Positioning:\nCompeting businesses such as ArawakFish Cargo Ges.m.b.h., Sanaa El-Amin, and Macaama Ocean Worldwide LLC maintain their positions, indicating that the incident did not significantly disrupt their hierarchical standing. New Alliances and Relationships:\nThe dendrogram indicates potential new alliances or strengthened relationships post-incident, especially among companies within close hierarchical proximity to SouthSeafood Express Corp.

Their prominent role and high connectivity suggest they might be key players in suspicious transactions related to illegal fishing.\n*Point 2 Dense Clusters:The dense clusters around these central nodes indicate high levels of transactional activity. This could be a sign of coordinated efforts to obscure illegal fishing activities through multiple layers of transactions. Isolation of Transactions:\n*Point 3 The presence of smaller, isolated subgroups suggests attempts to hide certain transactions from the main network. These isolated groups might be used to carry out suspicious activities without drawing attention.\n*Point 4 Systematic Patterns:The repeated patterns of smaller clusters connected to central nodes indicate a systematic approach to transactions. This systematic behavior could be indicative of coordinated efforts to manage and conceal illegal activities related to fishing.\nConclusion: Based on the analysis of the network graph, there are several visual hints that suggest the possibility of suspicious transactions related to illegal fishing. The prominent role of the central nodes, the dense clusters of transactions, the isolated subgroups, and the systematic patterns all point towards potential coordinated efforts to obscure illegal activities. Further investigation into the nature of these transactions and the entities involved is warranted to confirm these suspicions."
