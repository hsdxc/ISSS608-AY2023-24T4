As the chart progresses towards more exclusive properties like Terrace Houses, Semi-Detached, and Detached Houses, there's a notable decline in unit numbers, hinting at lesser availability or possibly higher pricing brackets for such properties.\n\nThis trend is significant for stakeholders, indicating a potential focus area for both market demand and real estate development strategies.\n\n**Create new columns**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Determine the address unit level.\nrealis2024Q1 <- realis2024Q1 %>%\n  mutate(\"Floor Level\" = if_else(str_detect(Address, '#'),\n                                   str_trim(str_extract(str_split(Address, \"#\", simplify = TRUE)[, 2], \"^[^\\\\-]*\")),\n                                   \"N.A.\"))\n\n#Determine the address unit level category (Low, middle or high).\nrealis2024Q1 <- realis2024Q1 %>%\n  mutate(`Floor Level Category` = case_when(\n    `Property Type` %in% c(\"Terrace House\", \"Semi-Detached House\", \"Detached House\") ~ \"N.A.\",\n    `Floor Level` == \"N.A.\" ~ \"Low\",\n    as.integer(`Floor Level`) <= 5 ~ \"Low\",\n    as.integer(`Floor Level`) <= 10 ~ \"Middle\",\n    TRUE ~ \"High\"\n  ))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Plot Boxplot**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reorder levels of 'Property Type' alphabetically\nrealis2024Q1$`Property Type` <- factor(realis2024Q1$`Property Type`, levels = c(\"Apartment\",\"Condominium\",\"Terrace House\", \"Semi-Detached House\",\"Detached House\",\"Executive Condominium\"))\n\n# Reorder levels of 'Floor Level Category' by \"High\", \"Middle\", \"Low\"\nrealis2024Q1$`Floor Level Category` <- factor(realis2024Q1$`Floor Level Category`, levels = c(\"High\", \"Middle\", \"Low\"))\n\n# Create the boxplot using ggplot2\nggplot(realis2024Q1, aes(x = `Property Type`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`, fill = `Floor Level Category`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"N.A.\" = \"gray\", \"Low\" = \"blue1\", \"Middle\" =\"blue3\", \"High\" = \"blue4\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Property Type\", y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\", fill = \"Floor Level Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**\\*\\* EDA 2 \\*\\***\n\nThe boxplot analysis highlights several significant findings, with a focus on median unit prices per square metre:\n\n1.  Terraced, semi-detached, and detached houses exhibit lower median prices in contrast to vertical living spaces such as apartments ,and condominiums. This discrepancy suggests a potential premium associated with apartment living, possibly attributed to location advantages, particularly in central urban areas.\n\n2.  Executive condominiums stand out with the lowest median price among all property types, implying a level of affordability. This could be due to the regulatory price controls.\n\n3.  Further exploration into median prices based on property type and floor levels reveals that higher floors command a premium for condominiums and apartments.\n\n4.  In contrast, executive condominiums exhibit a more uniform pricing pattern across different floors, in comparison to apartments and condominiums.\n\n**\\*\\* Summary\\*\\***\n\nThe analysis of property types using Pareto charts sheds light on the distribution within the market. Condominiums and apartments emerge as prominent, aligning with the Pareto principle by occupying a significant portion of total units. This suggests either heightened demand or extensive supply in these segments.\n\nThis finding is further corroborated by the examination of property types using boxplots. It highlights the preference for apartment and condominium living over landed housing types, emphasizing the premium facilities associated with such accommodations.\n\nIn essence, these analyses provide valuable insights into the property market, emphasizing the dominance of condominiums and apartments and their impact on demand and pricing dynamics.\n",
